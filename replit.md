# Overview

CashWatch is a React-based web application that enables users to earn money by watching advertisements. It offers a gamified experience including daily streaks, a referral system, and withdrawal functionalities. The platform is built using a modern full-stack architecture comprising React, Express, PostgreSQL, and shadcn/ui components. The project aims to provide a rewarding user experience and a robust backend for managing ad-based earnings.

# Recent Changes

## October 4, 2025 - Admin Panel React Hooks Fix
- **Critical Bug Fixed**: Admin panel showing black screen due to React Hooks violation
  - **Root Cause**: Conditional early returns (`if (adminLoading)` and `if (!isAdmin)`) were placed BEFORE useQuery hooks, violating the Rules of Hooks
  - **Solution**: Moved all useQuery hooks to the top of the component before any conditional returns
  - **Added**: `enabled: isAdmin` option to queries to prevent unnecessary API calls when user is not admin
  - **Impact**: Admin panel now displays correctly and shows pending withdrawal requests as expected
- **Verified**: Withdrawal creation and admin panel display flow working correctly:
  - Withdrawals are created with status 'pending' in database
  - Admin panel fetches pending withdrawals via `/api/admin/withdrawals/pending`
  - Pending requests display in admin panel under "Pending Withdrawal Requests" section

## October 4, 2025 - Critical Withdrawal Flow Fix
- **Withdrawal Balance Deduction Logic**: Fixed critical double-deduction bug by restructuring the withdrawal flow:
  - **Withdrawal Creation**: Balance is NO LONGER deducted when user creates withdrawal request - only validates sufficient balance exists
  - **Admin Approval**: Balance is deducted ONLY ONCE at approval time (this is the single point of deduction)
  - **Admin Rejection**: No refund needed since balance was never deducted
  - Added clear console logging: `ðŸ’° Deducting balance now for approved withdrawal: X TON` to track deduction events
- **Telegram Notification Formatting**: Fixed TON value formatting to handle up to 8 decimal places and properly remove trailing zeros (e.g., 261.01175 â†’ 261.0117, 12.00000 â†’ 12)
- **Plain Text Notifications**: Removed markdown formatting from all Telegram notifications for better display compatibility
